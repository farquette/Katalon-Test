	The patchouli that is the hallmark of Gucci fragrances here conveys a message of strength, while the voluptuousness of amber suggests deep femininity.

	Citrus, vanilla and greens lowering to notes of sandalwood, spices and musk. Recommended Use daytime

	'Obsession' perfume was launched by the design house of Calvin Klein in 1985

	When you think about Calvin Klein, initially you think of his clothing line – specifically his jeans and underwear lines (not to mention the famous ad with a young Brooke Shields). But Calvin Klein’s penchant for perfume was equally as cutting edge as his foray into fashion.

						Gucci Guilty							(PRF00269)
						
	
		Notes Consist Of Mandarin, Pink Pepper, Peach, Lilac, Geranium, Amber And Patchouli
	
		For Casual Use


	Gucci Guilty is a warm yet striking oriental floral with hedonism at its heart.
	
	The scent seizes the attention with a flamboyant opening born of the natural rush that is mandarin shimmering alongside an audacious fist of pink pepper.
	
	The middle notes are an alluring concoction of heady lilac and geranium, laced with the succulent tactility of peach - all velvet femininity with a beguiling hint of provocation.
	
	The patchouli that is the hallmark of Gucci fragrances here conveys a message of strength, while the voluptuousness of amber suggests deep femininity.

	Citrus, vanilla and greens lowering to notes of sandalwood, spices and musk. Recommended Use daytime

	&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;Obsession&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot; perfume was launched by the design house of Calvin Klein in 1985

	When you think about Calvin Klein, initially you think of his clothing line – specifically his jeans and underwear lines (not to mention the famous ad with a young Brooke Shields). But Calvin Klein’s penchant for perfume was equally as cutting edge as his foray into fashion.
